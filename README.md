# Quick-Note

By William Brandon

---

This is a simple extension which makes it easy to quickly create new empty files in a "scratch notes" directory. It is intended mainly for my own personal use.

## Features

Use the "`Quick Note: New Note`" command (shortcut `ctrl+K ctrl+N`) to create a new file in your scratch notes directory and open it for editing. Scratch note files are grouped into subdirectories based on the current date, and are named based on the current date and time. All times are computed in UTC.

By default, this extension creates notes as plain text files with the `.txt` extension. You can use the "`Quick Note: New Note with Language`" command (shortcut `ctrl+K ctrl+shift+N`) to override this behavior and specify the language.

## Extension Settings

You must set a value for `quick-note.notesDirectory` to use this extension.
